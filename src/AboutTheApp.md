In the index.js file within the src directory, I've implemented both the grid view and the table view components that direct to the same route. When the page loads, I make a call to the employee GET API to fetch all employees and display them on the index page.

For the add functionality, the user is directed to an add route, and the validation process occurs when the user clicks the "Save" button. To maintain a clean code structure, I've used two separate components for adding and editing employees due to their different routes. When in editing mode, the user is directed to an editing route. Here, I've employed Redux to manage the state. When a user clicks on an employee card, the employee's data, including their ID, is stored and dispatched to the data layer. This data is then retrieved in the edit form to populate the fields, and the ID is used to update that specific user. The same validation procedures used for adding employees are also applied during editing, and an editing API call is made to perform the update.

When it comes to deleting an employee, the ID is passed, and the page is simply reloaded by making a call to the employee GET API. It's important to note that API calls are kept separate, and the API endpoints are defined independently.
